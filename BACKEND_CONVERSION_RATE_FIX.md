# Backend Conversion Rate Alignment Fix

## Issue
The frontend is getting a 404 error when trying to fetch conversion rates from `/api/usdc/conversionrate`. This is causing the buy crypto functionality to fail with "Conversion rate not available" error.

## Current Status
- **Frontend**: Using `cryptoConverter` with `https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD` → **KES129 = USD1**
- **Backend**: Missing `/api/usdc/conversionrate` endpoint → **404 Not Found**

## Required Backend Changes

### 1. Create the Missing Endpoint
Please implement the `/api/usdc/conversionrate` endpoint that returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "rate": 134
}
```

### 2. Align Conversion Rates
To ensure consistency between frontend and backend:

**Option A: Use Frontend Rate (Recommended)**
- Backend should use the same API as frontend: `https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD`
- This ensures real-time rates and consistency

**Option B: Use Fixed Rate**
- Set a fixed rate (e.g., 134 KES = 1 USD)
- Update frontend to use this fixed rate

### 3. Update Buy Crypto Endpoint
Ensure the `/api/mpesa/buy-crypto` endpoint:
- Accepts the `currency` field in the request
- Uses the correct conversion rate for USD to KES conversion
- Returns the enhanced response structure as specified

## Frontend Changes Made
- Reverted to use `cryptoConverter` for now (working)
- Added success/failure cards for transaction results
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

## Next Steps
1. **Backend**: Implement `/api/usdc/conversionrate` endpoint
2. **Backend**: Ensure consistent conversion rates
3. **Frontend**: Switch back to backend rate once available
4. **Testing**: Verify alignment between frontend and backend rates

## Current Frontend Rate
- **Source**: `https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD`
- **Current Rate**: ~129 KES = 1 USD (real-time)
- **Status**: Working but needs backend alignment

Please implement the missing endpoint and let us know the preferred conversion rate approach.
